# Module 5 Challenge: Work Day Schedule

## Description
The goal of this project was to create an application that allows a user to add upcoming events to a schedule with dynamic features connected to current local time. This was accomplished with the use of jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. While developing this application I was able to learn how to effectively incorporate third-party APIs in my projects.

## Installation
Click this link to view the deployed website: https://farmfreshyeets.github.io/challenge-5-busy/

## Usage
To use this application, click on any of the timeblocks and you will be able to type in an upcoming event. Once you have added event to a timeblock, click the blue save button directly to the right to save your event to local storage. Once your events have all been saved, you can see them even after refreshing the page. To change the events in a time block, click on the time block again and you can add or remove events. As time moves to different hours of the day, the background color of time blocks will turn gray if they are in the past, red if they are the current hour, and green if they are still in the future.
